      How to play:
      <ul>
        <li>Player has a 9x9 grid with colorful balls. When the game starts, 5 balls, each having a random color, appear in random locations.</li>
        <li>After every move that doesn't result in balls disappearing, 3 balls appear (or less, if the grid is full).</li>
        <li>Moving a ball to another grid cell is allowed when there is a path to that cell from the starting point. Allowed directions are up, down, left and right.</li>
        <li>When a move results in a sequence of at least 5 balls of identical color in a row, column, or diagonally, this ball sequence disappears, and player's score counter updates.</li>
        <li>The game ends when the grid is full.</li>
      </ul>
